# Aussie Compiler

This is a simple, fun compiler project that uses Australian slang as a source language. The project includes a lexer that tokenizes source code into a series of tokens, which can then be used in further stages of compilation like parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation.

## Features

- Tokenizes Australian slang keywords like "mate", "blabber", "fairDinkum", "else", "barbie", "goodOnya", and "backToYa".
- Handles basic identifiers and numeric literals.
- Ignores whitespaces and treats them as token separators.

## Getting Started

To build the project, you'll need a C++ compiler that supports C++17.
